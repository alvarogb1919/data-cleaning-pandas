Welcome to my first project! My initial goal here will be to understand in which activity someone is more likley to get attacked by a shark. If possible, I will also try to see which regions experience the most attacks.

In terms of the first analysis intuitively I imagined that activities such as surfing and diving would be the ones in which sharks attacks have been more frequent. It is the case that surfing is actually the activity in which more shark attacks have been registered but surprisingly diving is not even in the top 5. Actually, the second most exposed activity has been just swimming. Please see below the top 5 activites that experienced the most shark attacks:

Following this analysis, I was also curious about the localization of these attacks. Based on my current knowledge, I wanted to explore the split of the top 5 activities in the following countries: USA, Australia, South Africa, Brazil, and New Zealand. I selected this countries since I believe they are ones with great costal extensions where people can swim and also practice water activities such as surfing, fishing, and diving. My hypothesis was that USA and South Africa would concentrate the majority of the attacks. I was right about the USA, as it was the country in which shark attacks took place more frequently within the top 3 activities, but South Africa was not really relevant with very few attacks relative to USA or Australia (top 2 overall). Please see below the detailed split:
